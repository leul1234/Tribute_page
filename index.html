      <p class="font"><i>I was lucky to get into computers when it was a very young and idealistic industry. There
          weren't many degrees offered in computer science, so people in computers were brilliant people from
          mathematics, physics, music, zoology, whatever. They loved it, and no one was really in it for the money...
          There are people around here who start companies just to make money, but the great companies, well, that's not
          what they're about."</i>
