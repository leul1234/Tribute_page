      <h2 class="font">Here's a time-line of Steve Job's life:</h2>
      <ul class="font" style="text-align: justify;">
        <br>
        <li><b>1971x</b>- Shortly after the third issue of Marvel Feature, the team was promoted to its own comic with The Defenders.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1972</b> - under writer Steve Englehart and artist Sal Buscema. Team members—including a returning Silver Surfer—rotated frequently, and Dr. Strange operated as a de facto leader, with the team using his Greenwich Village brownstone as its headquarters. The team gained its first new “regular” team member, the Asgardian warrior Valkyrie, in The Defenders</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1975</b> - the comic entered its most memorable era. Gerber pitted the team—now reduced to a nucleus of Hulk, Dr. Strange, Valkyrie, and Nighthawk—against a group of deviant scientists known as the Headmen. One of them had his head transplanted onto the body of a gorilla, while another’s head was a large ruby-red sphere. Other foes included a celestial mind-control cult called the Bozos and an elf with a gun. Fans were by turns amazed, amused, and bemused. Gerber left the comic after issue no.</li>

      <p class="font"><i>I was lucky to get into computers when it was a very young and idealistic industry. There
          weren't many degrees offered in computer science, so people in computers were brilliant people from
          mathematics, physics, music, zoology, whatever. They loved it, and no one was really in it for the money...
          There are people around here who start companies just to make money, but the great companies, well, that's not
          what they're about."</i>
